Syncing updates from upstream goexif
====================================

Camlistore does not need to have all test data of upstream goexif in its
repository. For that reason, do not merge the file
exif/regress_expected_test.go and the subfolder 'exif/samples' to
camlistore. When merging exif_test.go, make sure to keep the test path to
be "." instead of "samples".

Rationale: regress_expected_test.go is generated anew by exif_test.go (func
TestRegenRegress()), when the non-exported boolean variable 'regenRegress'
is set to true.  In upstream, this file is generated on the subfolder
called 'samples', which contains some JPGs. Since Camlistore omits the samples
folder, we change the exif_test.go to use the goexif/exif folder directly
(which contains the single sample1.jpg) instead of the samples subfolder.
Unless new test images are added, regress_expected_test.go does not need to
be regenerated. It is unlikely that Camlistore will add new test data.
