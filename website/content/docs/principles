<h1>Principles</h1>

<p><b>TODO:</b> elaborate.  This is just a quick sketch.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disk is cheap and getting cheaper. No need to delete in general.</li>

  <li>Put the user in control.  Own your data.</li>

  <li>Privacy and paranoia</li>

  <li>Decentralization is important, but..</li>

  <li>End users won't be dorks.  Must also be possible to be easy,
  hosted.</li>

  <li>Content-Addressability has so many great properties (validation,
  cachability, etc).  Use it as much as possible.</li>

  <li>Redundancy and over-explicitness is fine.  Compression will
  help.  Redundancy and over-explicitness will be convenient for
  future digital archeologists, too.</li>

</ul>
